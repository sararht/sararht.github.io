ABSTRACT = {In the manufacturing industry, inspection systems play a crucial role in ensuring product quality. High-resolution profilometric sensors have become increasingly popular for inspection due to their ability to provide detailed surface information. However, the development and testing of inspection systems can be costly and time-consuming. This paper presents the development of a simulation of an inspection system using a high-resolution profilometric sensor. A geometrical and noise model is proposed to simulate the readings of any actual profilometric sensor. The model replicates the sensor’s movement on the CAD model of the inspected part. The model incorporates the physical properties of the sensor and combines noise sources from sensor uncertainty and speckle noise induced by the roughness of the material. Our contribution lies in noise modeling. This work proposes a combination of Perlin noise to simulate the speckle noise and Gaussian noise for the uncertainty-related noise. Perlin noise is generated based on the surface roughness parameters of the inspected part. The accuracy of the simulation system is evaluated by comparing the simulated scans with real scans. The results highlight the ability to simulate real scans of different parts, using commercial sensor specifications and the CAD model of the inspected part.},
