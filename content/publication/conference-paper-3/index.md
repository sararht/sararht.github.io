abstract: Visual inspection of manufactured products is a field in constant expansion. In this work we present a method to create a high resolution panorama (1mm/pixel) of a large rectangular plate using a mobile robot with two RGB-D cameras. The panorama is intended to analyze the surface in search of possible defects and identify areas of interest that have been encircled using a high contrast mark. Identifying which points belong to the surface plane and estimating the amount of distortion caused by the perspective correction we are able to form a panorama of a 4400 by 2500 mm plate with errors lower than 2% and a resolution of 1 mm/pixel.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This paper presents a method for creating a high-resolution (1mm/pixel) panorama of large plates using a mobile robot with RGB-D cameras, enabling defect detection with perspective correction and errors below 2%.
