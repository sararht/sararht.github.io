## About Me

Hi, I'm Sara Roos-Hoefgeest, a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Oviedo. My research focuses on Computer Vision, Robotics, and Artificial Intelligence, exploring innovative solutions in these fields.

Beyond academia, I’m passionate about sports. I enjoy basketball, bouldering, and running as part of my regular routine. Whenever I have more time, I also love skiing and surfing, and recently, I’ve taken on the challenge of triathlons.
